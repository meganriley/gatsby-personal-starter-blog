My journey in tech began at my very first job out of college, where I worked at a startup in NYC. There was a company-wide Hackathon where the software engineers could build anything they wanted, as long as it was somehow related to the product. I saw the magic they created with various apps and I was inspired to acquire those skills myself.

Since my time there, I've learned so many things! I dabbled in HTML and CSS, became proficient in JavaScript and Python, and explored Django and React (in fact, I just started learning React a month ago and am obsessed with it!). I took Intro to Programming, Discrete Mathematics, and two Data Structures & Algorithms classes at a masters level. I tried (and decided it wasn't for me) a bootcamp. At my last job, I pair programmed with a senior developer every week. I've made breakthroughs with learning difficult concepts, my code has gotten way better than when I first started, and I continue to build and learn lots of cool things!

I'm hoping to use this blog to share my experience as a developer, show how I work through projects or coding exercises, and remind me how much I've learned (imposter syndrome is so real!).

I'd love any feedback or collaboration. I can't wait to get started, and I can't wait to hear from you!
